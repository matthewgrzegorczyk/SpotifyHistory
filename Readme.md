## Basic info
**Spotify History** is an app written for my student`s project.
It's written in **ANSI C**, as I have stated earlier.
App only works in Windows as there is no given API from Spotify to check what is the current track you're playing on Spotify and the only possible option at the moment is to check the title window of Spotify.

## Features
- Current Song
- History

App saves the current playing track to the **Current song.txt** file.
It can be used later for dipslaying info about the currently playing track in software like **OBS** which let's you display text on video from text based files etc.

History is saved in **History.txt** file when app closes. You can close the app by pressing ESC key or simply closing the Spotify app.

## Usage
You can download the program - it's just the single *.exe file as it's the console application.
App is working only when the Spotify application is running, if not it's closing automatically.
If you want to close the application, just focus it and hit ESC key.

## Requirements
- Windows 7 or newer. Tested on Windows 8.1.
- Spotify Desktop Client.

### Hardware
- Machine with at least 1GB of RAM. (Program itself needs around 1-2MB of RAM. Depends on how big is history keept within the app).
- Intel Pentium Dual Core equivalent.
Testing.
